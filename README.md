# Learning Plus Scheduler

## Description
This is a website to view vailable courses and sign up for classes at Learning Plus, a fake company for this school project.

## Project Status
I'm not planning on working any further on this except maybe some minor cleanup.

## Instalation
fork and clone your own copy of the repository.
navigate to the folder.
run `bundle install`, `npm install --prefix client`, `rails db:migrate db:seed`. After that, start the server for the front and back ends. I open 2 terminals in one I run `rails s`, and `npm start --prefix client`.

## Usage
You can sign up as a user. You can log in and out of your account. You can view available classes. You can sign up for classes. You can view, edit, and delete the classes you have signed up for.

## Support
There is no support for this project.

## Roadmap
If I were to continue this project, I would like to change how the days are stored so I can display the class list in chronilogical order. Set up a filter and select for the class list. I would like to change the edit form back to a dropdown. Have my schedule display chronilogically.
